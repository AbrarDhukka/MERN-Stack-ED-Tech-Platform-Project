# Frontend tech :
 - To build the front end, we use frameworks and libraries such as ReactJS, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
 - We also use CSS and Tailwind, which are styling frameworks that help make the user interface look good and responsive. 
 - Additionally, we use some npm packages to add extra functionality to the front end. 
 - To manage the state of the applicatio,we use Redux, which is a popular state management library for React. 
 - Finally, we use a development environment called VSCode, which is a popular code editor, to develop the front end.


# Backend Tech :
- Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools used:

- The back end of StudyNotion uses a range of frameworks, libraries, and tools to ensure its functionality and performance, including:
Node.js: Node.js is used as the primary framework for the back end.
- MongoDB: MongoDB is used as the primary database, providing a flexible and scalable data storage solution.
- Express.js: Express.js is used as a web application framework, providing a range of features and tools for building web applications.
- JWT: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for authentication and authorization, providing a secure and reliable way to manage user credentials.
- Bcrypt: Bcrypt is used for password hashing, adding an extra layer of security to user data.
- Mongoose: Mongoose is used as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, providing a way to interact with MongoDB using JavaScript.
